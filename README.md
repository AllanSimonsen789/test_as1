## Reflections
### 1.1	Shooting

2	The bullet missed the target(the man)
3	Something blocked the bullet
4	The woman fired a blank.
5	Gun was pointed in the wrong direction
6	The man was so far away that the bullet did not reach him
7	The magazine was empty
8	The gun was not cocked properly
9	The man was so overweight that his bellyfat stopped the bullet
10	The man was hit in a nonvital body part
### 1.2	Alien visit
1	Pick up toothbrush with right hand, grab it by the handle.
2	Pick up toothpaste tube with left hand.
3	Flip open toothpaste tube with left thumb while holding it.
4	Position the newly exposed toothpaste head above the head of the toothbrush so that the content of the tube will flow out on top of the toothbrush head(picture from Brobible.com
5	Put down toothpaste
5.1	Optional. Wet the toothbrush with toothpaste on top
6	Open your mouth and close your teeth together.
7	Push the toothbrush head against the front of your teeth.
8	Move the toothbrush in circular motions so that the head of toothbrush hits every part of your front teeth.
9	Continue moving the toothbrush in circular motion around all your front teeth, also the ones inside your check.
10	Open mouth
11	Move the toothbrush back and forth on top of your bottom and top teeth row.
12	As the last step move the toothbrush back and forth on the inside of your teeth, both bottom and top row of teeth 
13	Turn the toothbrush sideways and push against your check, this way you can brush the teeth the furthest back in each row, remember to get the front, top and back of these teeth.
14	Rinse the toothbrush for toothpaste. 
15	Rinse your mouth and spit out any residue toothpaste

## 3 My thoughts on TDD
When using TDD there is a clear goal for the code you’re writing, to make the test green. Therefore, there is no doubt in your head what needs to be done. Also a good thing is the fact that you already have test cases that you can test your code against. No need to manually test your new code, and you also don’t need to go through the pain of writing test after you’re done with you new code. 
The annoying part of TDD is the fact that you might now know what to test for, or you have to calculate the results for the test manually. Another annoying part is the fact that you have to create a lot of empty methods and classes that return nothing to make the code “compile” since you reference these methods in your test code.
 This was a relatively easy task but I was surprised how easy It was to write the test cases first, I’ve always seen it as huge obstacle to write test before you know what methods exists. I was also presently surprised by the guidance that the test can give during developing code. 
I don’t think TDD will make write test that I would otherwise would not think of. 
I think a big disadvantage is the fact that when writing the code you focus on making the test green. So you´ll rarely think about being able to handle the edge cases unless you have tests that focus on these edge cases.
